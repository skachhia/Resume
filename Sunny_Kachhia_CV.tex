\cvsection{ABOUT ME}
% \begin{quote}
% ``If you don't have any shadows, you're not standing in the light.''
% \end{quote}
A Full-Stack engineer with an overall experience of \textbf{7+ years} including \textbf{5 years} as a \textbf{Java Software Engineer} and 3 years as a \textbf{Web Engineer} with a proven track record of successfully delivering more than 5 projects.\\~\\

% A curious soul always passionate about learning new technologies, thriving to deliver end to end engineering products with a proven track record of successfully leading and deploying more than 5 projects.\\~\\

% At \textbf{Aindra} I was responsible for building projects from scratch, leveraging in house \textbf{AI platforms} for \textbf{face, object detection} and \textbf{cervical cancer cell detection}.\\~\\

A curious soul always intrigued by tech, my interest was piqued while working at \textbf{Aindra} where I was responsible for building projects from scratch, leveraging in house \textbf{AI platforms} for \textbf{face, text, object detection} and \textbf{cervical cancer cell detection}.\\~\\

After moving to \textbf{Webonise Lab}, I realised my flair for front end technologies as well, hence committed as a Full-Stack engineer ( \textbf{Java} and \textbf{React}) and now further looking to enhance my \textbf{leadership} skills. In the process, I have already started participating in the \textbf{staffing} activities and trained more than 20 new recruits on \textbf{React, GraphQL and Spring frameworks}.
